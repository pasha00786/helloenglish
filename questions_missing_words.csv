Double-checking the alarm on your alarm clock can save you a lot of money and heartache. I don't know how many times I have failed to wake up on time due to an alarm that was set for the wrong, wake-up time.

That way, one can be relatively sure that he or she will wake up at the proper time.This paragraph is about: How to set an alarm clock.

Refinishing furniture can be very rewarding. After the old paint or stain is stripped away and/or sanded off and a new coat of paint or stain is applied, a dramatic difference is often immediately apparent.

These two things, alone, can result in a unique, new-looking piece of furniture instead of a shabby, old, dinged-up piece.This paragraph is about: Paint versus stain
